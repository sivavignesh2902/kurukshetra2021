                he Green Revolution, or the Third Agricultural Revolution, is the set<br></br> of research technology transfer initiatives occurring between 1950 and the late 1960s, that increased agricultural production worldwide, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s.[1] The initiatives resulted in the adoption of new technologies, including high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of cereals, especially dwarf wheat and rice. It was associated with chemical fertilizers, agrochemicals, and controlled water-supply (usually involving irrigation) and newer methods of cultivation, including mechanization. All of these together were seen as a 'package of practices' to supersede 'traditional' technology and to be adopted as a whole.[2] The key elements of the revolution include : 1) Use of last capital and technological inputs . 2) adoption of modern scientific methods of farming. 3) use of high yielding varieties of seeds. 4) proper use of chemical fertilizers. 5) consolidation of land holdings.

Both the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation were heavily involved in its <br></br>initial development in Mexico.[3][4] One key leader was Norman Borlaug, the "Father of the Green Revolution", who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. He is credited with saving over a billion people from starvation. The basic approach was the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers.

The term "Green Revolution" was first used by William S. Gaud, the administrator of t<br></br>he U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in a speech on 8 March 1968. He noted the spread of the new technologies as:
<br></br>
"These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a ne<br></br>w revolution. It is not a violent Red Revolution like that of the Soviets, nor is it a White Revolution like that of the Shah of Iran. I call it the Green Revolution."[5][6]
