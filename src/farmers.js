                <p>A farmer (also called an agriculturer[citation needed]) is a person engaged in agriculture,     <br></br>raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry,<br></br> or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past, a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish).

Over 1/2 billion farmers are smallholders, most of whom are in developing countries, and who economically support  <br></br>    almost two billion people.[2][3] Globally, women constitute more than 40% of agricultural employees.[4]</p>
